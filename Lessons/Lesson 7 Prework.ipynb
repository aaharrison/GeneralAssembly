    "Patsy is a simple way to split your data up into target and predictor values. It is very similar to statsmodel's OLS parameter formula. It is a handy way to add/remove features with ease. The generic formula of how to use patsy is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "formula = 'target ~ predictor1 + predictor2 + predictor3 + predictor4 ... + predictor100 - 1'\n",

We use the training set to train our model with an algorithm and then use that algorithm to run on our testing set to make sure that our results is consistent and stable. Another way to think about it is this.\n",

Suppose our target variable is categorical with 0s and 1s, it would be problematic if our train_test_split put all the 0s or all the 1s in the training set with none in the testing set.

    "1. F1-Score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. The harmonic mean is used here rather than the more conventional arithmetic mean because the harmonic mean is more appropriate for averaging rates. The f1-score's best value is 1 and worst value is 0, like the precision and recall scores. It is a useful metric for taking into account both measures at once.\n",
